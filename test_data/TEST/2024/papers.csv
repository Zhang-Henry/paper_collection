Thus, there is an urgent need to quantitatively evaluate LLMs as agents on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional benchmark that consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities.""}","{""value"": [""Large language models"", ""Autonomous agents"", ""Reasoning"", ""Evaluation"", ""Benchmark""]}",ICLR.cc,2024,https://openreview.net/pdf/test1.pdf
